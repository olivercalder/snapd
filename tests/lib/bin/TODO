ONCE THINGS ARE RENAMED/MADE UNIFORM THIS SHOULD BECOME A README WITHOUT THE TODO PART!

This directory collects useful utility commands that can be used in
our spread test suites. (They are separate from the shell function
libraries *.sh in the level above.)

Commands here should have names that differentiate them from most
commands in {/usr,}{/bin,/sbin} (historically we have used *-tool
names but actually *-tool commands do exist there.)

If possible the name should indicate what they do or if many things
what their area is.

All of them invoked without arguments should either do something
informative/non-destructive or print usage.

All of them should support at least a -h help option.

To achieve the naming goals we are going to use names with dots in
them (not a very common pattern in *bin, mostly as command.variant) of
the form:

  <context|entity>.<action|property|activity>
  do.<invocation-modifier>

the 2nd form is for commands taking themselves a command to execute,
wrapping/modifying its execution (do.retry, do.memory-observe, ...)
without any particular implied context.

The commands might take one or multiple subcommands themselves if
meaningful, subcommands should use '-' as internal word separator.

If a subcommand executes other commands it should usually be called
"exec" (suite.session exec ...", abbreviated as session.do).

Commands that operate on state that crosses the spread task boundary
should usually be called "suite.<activity>", where activity might be a
system tool name or concept (suite.lxd, suite.apt, suite.session, ...). And
then take more specific subcommands.

Exceptions to the rules: not, MATCH, REBOOT, any-python

TODO:

Things to fix or rename ATM:

retry-tool -> do.retry
memory-tool -> do.memory-observe
mountinfo-tool -> mountinfo.query
version-tool -> version.compare

user-tool -> suite.user
  fix with no args
  fix -h help

apt-tool -> suite.apt
  use any-python?
  fix no args
  fix to have -h

lxd-tool -> suite.lxd
  fix no args
  fix to have -h

snap-tool -> snapd.tool
  fix no args
  fix to have -h

session-tool -> suite.session
  fix to have -h
  convert --ACTION into subcommands
  require "exec" subcommand to execute a command
  have do.session as shortcut for "exec"?

invariant-tool -> suite.invariant
  fix to have -h
