summary: Check that default tracks work

environment:

    A_TRACK: 2.0

prepare: |
    snap install http jq

execute: |
    # first, sanity check that the snap has a default track
    snap run http GET "https://api.snapcraft.io/v2/snaps/info/$A_SNAP" Snap-Device-Series:16 > info

    # TODO: check the output of 'snap info' for the default-track-having snap
    # once that works as expected (order of tracks is wrong right now)

    # TODO: check error output when trying to install from [default]/stable

    # now install a snap that has a default track
    snap install --candidate "$A_SNAP" | MATCH "$A_TRACK/candidate"
