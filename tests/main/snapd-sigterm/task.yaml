summary: Ensure that snapd quits on SIGTERM

details: |
    This is a regression test for LP#1946656. We want to check that a pending
    connection can not prevent snapd from quitting.

restore: |
    echo "Restarting snapd"
    # No harm if it was already running
    systemctl start snapd.service

execute: |
    echo "Make a request, keep the connection open"
    nc -U /run/snapd.socket << EOF &
    GET /v2/apps HTTP/1.1
    Host: localhost

    EOF

    echo "Stopping snapd, and measuring time"
    TEST_TIME0="$(date +'%s')"
    systemctl stop snapd.service

    retry -n 10 sh -c 'systemctl status snapd.service | MATCH "inactive"'
    TEST_TIME1="$(date +'%s')"

    if ((TEST_TIME1 > TEST_TIME0 + 5)); then
        echo "Stopping snapd took more than 5 seconds!"
        exit 1
    fi
