summary: Ensure that the content slots for classic snaps works.

details: |
    The content-sharing interface interface allows a snap to access contents from
    other snap. It is possible to have content slots in classic snaps, where
    confined snaps can connect to.

    A snap which defines the content sharing plug must be shown in the interfaces list.
    The plug must be autoconnected on install and, as usual, must be able to be
    reconnected.
